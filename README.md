#piwigo-stereo#
A plugin for the Piwigo image gallery that lets you display and manage 3-D
images as wiggle gifs. This plugin transforms uploaded .mpo images into
two-frame gif images for viewing on a 2-D screen.

It also allows you to change the frame offset to focus on objects at different
depths. When viewing an image, use H, J, K, and L to change the offset. Holding
shift moves 10 pixels at a time. Administrators have a tab on the photo edit
screen to adjust the offset for other viewers.

Requires exiftool and imagemagick. Uses libgif-js.
